# AI Usage Report

This report provides a brief overview of the AI tools utilized in this software development project.

## AI Tools Used:

*   **v0 by Vercel**: Used for rapid UI component generation, accelerating prototyping and reducing boilerplate code for front-end elements with Tailwind CSS.
*   **GitHub Copilot**: Served as an in-editor coding assistant, providing real-time code suggestions and completions to increase productivity and reduce cognitive load.
*   **Cline**: CLINE is a VS Code extension that acts as an open-source AI coding "agent." It uses a "Plan & Act" workflow to execute multi-step tasks, giving developers full control and transparency over changes. You can configure it to use various AI models (like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or local models), and all actions—from editing code to running terminal commands—are auditable and require your approval.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Utilized for complex problem-solving, architectural design, and optimizing core business logic due to its advanced reasoning capabilities and large context window.
*   **Claude 4 Sonnet**: Primarily used for code generation, bug fixing, and refining UI/UX components and animations, known for its clean code output and strong instruction-following.
*   **DeepSeek**: Applied for routine, cost-sensitive tasks such as generating utility functions, standard documentation snippets, and assisting with data scripts.
